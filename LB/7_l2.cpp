// 1009. Complement of Base 10 Integer
// The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0's to 1's and all the 1's to 0's in its binary representation.

// For example, The integer 5 is "101" in binary and its complement is "010" which is the integer 2.
// Given an integer n, return its complement.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: n = 5
// Output: 2
// Explanation: 5 is "101" in binary, with complement "010" in binary, which is 2 in base-10.
